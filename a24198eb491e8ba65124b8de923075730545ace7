Since only these 2 jobs are using the subprojects. \nBut notice that the release-version-java-daily (which is replaced by gerrit-maven-stage) does not uses the subproject variables. Which means, they are using root pom.xml\nYou can see the reference in \nhttps://jenkins.onap.org/view/vfc/job/vfc-nfvo-driver-ems-master-release-version-java-daily/configure\nNotice this job uses root pom. \n\nIf this release job would have been the {subproject} one, then yes, what you said would have to be done.",
