      "message": "Given you\u0027re primarily trying to increase the size of the instance to get it to build properly I would suggest doing the following:\n\nRemove all the current node definitions and set just one at the same level as your project variable below.\n\nAdditionally, instead of jumping up to such a large instance, let\u0027s step to the next size which would be \u0027centos7-basebuild-4c-4g\u0027 If that fails for whatever reason, we can step up to the 8c-8g instance, but I would continue to use the centos7-basebuild flavor and not the ubuntu1604-docker flavor since that instance is targeted at running docker, not being a maven build host.",

      "message": "Hi Andy,\n\nThose are good points!  I\u0027ll change the configuration and submit another version momentarily.  The reason I put the node over-ride at the job definition level was that I didn\u0027t think I could define it higher in the project template based on the openstack jjb schema that I was looking at.  \n\nBut you know this stuff better than I do, so I\u0027ll make that change and flip over to a slightly smaller centos jenkins slave and hopefully that will unblock us.\n\nregards,\n\nDave Adams.",
