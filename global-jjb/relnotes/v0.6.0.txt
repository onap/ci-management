global-jjb v0.6.0 Release Notes
===============================

Thanks to Andy, Anil, and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Notable changes since v0.5.0
----------------------------

1167954 Anil Belur      Make packer-cloud-env variable configurable
packer-cloud-env was hardcoded previously but we've made it overrideable via
config for users who name their files differently.

b2ad485 Thanh Ha        Rename settings-file to mvn-settings in templates
We've renamed settings-file to mvn-settings to lineup with what was being used
in OpenDaylight for this setting. It also aligns with other settings that are
prefixed with mvn-.
