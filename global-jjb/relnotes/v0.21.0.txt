global-jjb v0.21.0 Release Notes
================================

Thanks to Andrew, Anil, Jessica, Luis, Thanh, and Trevor
for contributing to this release.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

efc1f45 Thanh Ha        Consolidate keypair default names to jenkins-ssh
This is a potential breaking change. If you are not explicitly declaring
`jenkins-ssh-credential` in defaults.yaml or `KEY_PAIR_NAME` in clouds.cfg
for the "jenkins-cfg" job. Then the default naming for these keypairs is now
`jenkins-ssh`. Make sure to update either the Jenkins Credentials name or
set the explicit configurations as mentioned previously.


Notable changes since v0.20.0
-----------------------------

d1fb28b Luis Gomez      Allow any project/branch to deploy jjb jobs
The "jjb-deploy" job can now be run from any Gerrit project. When run against
an "ci-management" repo then it will perform as it did before. When run against
a non-ci-manamgent repo the job will fetch the master branch from ci-management
and deploy the job from there.

55ab265 Thanh Ha        Setup tools in global-jjb tox.ini
Creates a global tox.ini which can be used by projects to use common
PyPi tools. This replaces the need to "source /path/to/venv"
everywhere in our scripts to jump to different tools.
Instead we replace it with one of:

    tox -q -c jjb/global-jjb/tox.ini -e openstack -- {parameters}

d9aeddd Thanh Ha        Add jenkins-init-scripts to global-jjb
These are the minion initialization scripts that start running
when our cloud plugin spawns a new minion. They are responsible
for prepping the minion for Jenkins to take over and run the job.

efc1f45 Thanh Ha        Consolidate keypair default names to jenkins-ssh
This is an attempt to consolidate all our different instances
of the ssh-keypair name all over the place. By default we will
consolidate on `jenkins-ssh` as the default keypair name.

a079f1b Andrew Grimberg Add package lists to job logs
Jobs will now archive a package-listing of OS level package installations for
reference in the log server.

f6db870 Trevor Bramwell Configurable Timed Trigger for Packer Merge Jobs
Packer jobs timed triggers can now be overrided by projects that want a
different timer than default of "@monthly".

b83660f Jessica Wagantall       Add INFO.yaml verify jobs
New job for verifying LF INFO.yaml files. These files will be used in the
future to manage things like project permissions from inside the repo.
