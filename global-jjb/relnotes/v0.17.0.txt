global-jjb v0.17.0 Release Notes
================================

Thanks to Christopher, Jessica, and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

1. c26afec Add script to manage Jenkins cloud cfg

No action is necessary as this feature is disabled by default however if a
project is using the Jenkins OpenStack Cloud Plugin we highly recommend
configuring the ci-management repo to manage this plugin configuration as
it makes the cloud configuration much more transparent to the project and
allows the configuration to be stored in the repo.

Full documentation on how to use this feature is available in the global-jjb
documentation here:

http://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org/projects/global-jjb/en/latest/jjb/lf-ci-jobs.html#lf-global-jjb-jenkins-cfg-merge

An example of the OpenDaylight project's configuration for this plugin can
be seen here https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/68907
