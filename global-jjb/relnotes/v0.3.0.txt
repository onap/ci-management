global-jjb v0.3.0 Release Notes
===============================

Thanks to Andy, Anil, JamO, and Jeremy for contributing to this release.


Notable changes since v0.2.0
----------------------------

07b824c Thanh Ha        Enable archive pattern support
Archiving artifacts via pattern from ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS job parameter is now
supported.

afb0041 Thanh Ha        Use pipdeptree instead of freeze
pipdeptree provides a dependency graph which is more useful than just a pip
freeze. So some virtualenvs are now using this to print out the installed
packages in the virtualenv. We later determined that this is too verbose for
lftools virtualenv though so removed it for that virtualenv via 3a0a6bc.

63d7528 Jamo Luhrsen    Use pip module instead of pip itself
62f7abd Jamo Luhrsen    Call pipdeptree from python -m
Workaround a kernel limitation and virtualenv's really long shebang lines
causing jobs that have over 128 characters to fail their builds.

52980f2 Thanh Ha        Add python tox verify job
Python tox job is now available to run tox for Python projects.

c887df2 Anil Belur      Enable sar report collection for global-jjb
Sar reports are now a part of lf-infra-publish macro which provides time
sliced resource usage data during a build. It's also printed as part of the
_sys-info.log at the end of the build.

34ab380 Thanh Ha        Create Maven release job
New Maven job which removes -SNAPSHOT from pom.xml files and produces a release
staging repo for Maven projects. This job also stores git.bundles in the log
server so that the release commits can be reproduced and released after the
staging repo has been promoted for release.
