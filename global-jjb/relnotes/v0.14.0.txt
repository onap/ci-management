global-jjb v0.14.0 Release Notes
================================

Thanks to Jeremy and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Notable changes since v0.13.0
-----------------------------

9ace820 Thanh Ha        Update remote gerrit to use GERRIT_URL
Fixes issue when GIT_BASE and GIT_URL are pointing to a mirror. The git review
command needs it's gerrit remote to point to Gerrit.

7ce2809 Thanh Ha        Update merge job to work with common-packer
8cc91c0 Thanh Ha        Update packer file_path triggers
fec0bb3 Anil Belur      Improve packer-validate debugging output
Updates packer ci jobs to work with the new common-packer project. The updates
were designed to be backwards compatible so should not break projects that have
not yet added common-packer to their builds.

f3ed649 Thanh Ha        Use detox to run tox in parallel
Switches our parallel tox calls to using detox instead of GNU parallel. detox
is more aware of the tox environment than GNU parallel was which intermittently
caused build issues for projects that had a lot of envs defined.

89c7b0f Thanh Ha        Prioritize MAVEN_PARAMS to override OPTIONS
When passing mvn-parmas for a parameter that's already defined by scripts it
will now prioritize the project's declaration over the default environment.

5ffdf16 Thanh Ha        Allow SONAR_MAVEN_GOAL to be configurable
Sonar Maven goal is now configurable allowing projects to specify the version
of the sonar plugin they wish to use in cases where they do not want to use the
latest sonar plugin version.

645a9ea Andrew Grimberg Base sigul macros and scripts
Adds a new sigual macro which in the future will be used for signing artifacts
in the CI system. It is currently not production ready.
