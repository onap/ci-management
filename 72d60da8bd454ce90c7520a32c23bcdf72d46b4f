      "message": "Just a hint on this from my side - please look at how I configured the jjb template to leverage tox builder in https://gerrit.onap.org/r/c/ci-management/+/102391/3/jjb/integration/integration-templates.yaml line 61-68 to make it pick the tox.ini in right directory - you need to set \"tox-dir\" accordingly for lf-infra-tox-parameters parameters and then use lf-infra-tox-install and lf-infra-tox-run builders. I think the correct workflow is not to use tox-run.sh explicitly but through those two builders, then it\u0027ll work. \n\ntox-run.sh is run as part of lf-infra-tox-run builder but it expects setup done by lf-infra-tox-install to be done prior to it.",
