      "message": "Hi, I think daily is needed, because the snapsthot image is built daily. And policy has several modules: common/parent/model which are not building dockers but application dockers depend on those modules, If there is a change in those modules, then we need daily snapshot docker build in order to pick up the change. Hope that explained why we need daily cron.",
