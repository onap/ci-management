      "message": "The clone to ci-management needs to be using SSH. \nThe reason being, many teams will use this cloned code to make changes and push them into Gerrit which will fail if their remotes are HTTP. Although that can be fixed with extra steps, cloning SSH from the start makes things easier. \n\nI would suggest we add the instructions like:\n\nClone ci-management:\n   git clone ssh://\u003cLFID\u003e@gerrit.onap.org:29418/ci-management\nFetch the gerrit hooks:\n   gitdir\u003d$(git rev-parse --git-dir); scp -p -P 29418 \u003cLFID\u003e@gerrit.onap.org:hooks/commit-msg ${gitdir}/hooks/",

      "message": "Hi Jess,\n\nI can\u0027t see any problem with pushing changes to gerrit over HTTPS protocol. That\u0027s exactly how I and my colleges are working on OPNFV (over 3 years) and on ONAP projects. BTW, I\u0027ve used exactly the same https clone command to prepare this patch.\n\nAs I\u0027ve mentioned in the commit message - this is exactly the format, which you\u0027ll get (anonymous https is a default) as a hint in gerrit GUI at https://gerrit.onap.org/r/#/admin/projects/ci-management - under link \"Clone with commit-msg hook\".\n\nI can see following advantages:\n\n* works over proxies and firewalls\n* can be used without modifications, just cut\u0026paste from docs to console (no need to specify lfid like in previous ssh case)\n* suitable for both non-LF members (inspect code anonymously) and LF members (modify \u0026 push)\n\nPlease advise,\nMartin",

      "message": "I agree, in docs I typically prefer the http clone method as it can be cloned anonymously without an account.\n\nIf using git-review (which I highly recommend) the hook install step could be shorted to simply:\n\n git review -s\n\nThis setups up a 2nd remote \"gerrit\" for pushing and installs the git hook. This is a handy setup because we can do 2 things:\n\n1) Git fetches via anonymous http\n2) Git pushes via gerrit remote `git push gerrit ...`",
