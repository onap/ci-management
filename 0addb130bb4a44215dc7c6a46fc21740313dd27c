      "message": "@Jesica, we have tests that will start a docker container and run tests over it. Requirement for this is only to have to docker. We think that using image centos7-docker-8c-8g should be enough.\nBut we had some doubts whether we should add it for all jobs, please let us if we changed more than required.\nThanks",

      "message": "@Claudio, the docker node is the most complete when it comes to tooling, but the main difference is the existence of docker in it. For jobs that do not use docker I would recommend using the builder-4c-4g nodes since is little bit cheaper than the 8c-8g ones. \n\nThere is no functional issue if you want to use this node for non docker jobs though.",
